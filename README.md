# NSudo_Installer
Simple installer to copy NSudo to custom location, setting context menu entries accordingly, and adding its path to System Environment Variables Paths (this way you can just write "NSudo" instead of whole path in your batch files).

Options (prompt for user choice): 
- Custom Json files for Nsudo shortcuts with "Task Scheduler", "Registry Editor", "PowerShell", "notepad" "Component Services" and "Command prompt"
- Custom Tiles (bigger and transparent icons) for start menu pinning.
- Start menu shortcut creation.
